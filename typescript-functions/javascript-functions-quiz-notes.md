## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

  -Blocks of reusable code designed to perform specific tasks

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

If it is not an arrow function, it has the word function followed by parentheses that include parameters, followed by curly braces, that has a return value (and sometimes an expression)

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

Function name and in parentheses are the arguments. This when the function is initialized

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

Use of parameters versus arguments, you are not defining a function rather calling it so it can be utilized, and lastly when a function is being called it is actually executing some code

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

A parameter is what is being declared in a function while an argument is a parameter when a function is being called

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

They allow functions to be more versatile and reusable

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

It ends the execution of the function and assigns a value if the function is called

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?

Declaring the function name followed by the assignment operator, followed by the parameters, followed by the => followed by curly braces, and lastly a return statement

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?

They have an implicit return, meaning they can return a value without using the return keyword
