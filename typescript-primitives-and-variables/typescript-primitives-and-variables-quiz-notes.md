## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

Storing information, such as a number, string, list, etc.

- How do you **declare** a variable?

Using var, let, or const (mostly let or const)

Using the assignment operator (=)

- What characters are allowed in variable names?

You can use letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. They can only start with a letter, $, or \_

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?

Capitalization matters. I.e. the variable name and Name are not the same

Represents text using a sequence of characters. I.e. ‘Shea’

- What is the purpose of a number?

Represent both integers and floating-point values. I.e. 20 or 25.2. Can be used in mathematical operations.

Represent one of two values; true or false. Often used in conditionals

Assignment operator

- How do you update the value of a variable?

Using let you can reassign the variable by using the same variable name (case sensitive) and reassign it using the assignment operator

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

Null means no value or empty value, while undefined means that the variable has been declared but not initialized with a value

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?

So that what is logged to the console is clear and there is no confusion on what is being logged

String, number, boolean, null, and undefined
