Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?

By changing the value of className

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?

By using querySelector then assigning the text content of the object to its new value

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?

It is as it allows javascript to watch out for the event instead of the person creating the code

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?

More difficult because it would be hard to know when the colors, etc. should change
